# Iteration Plan

**Purpose:** Complete implementation roadmap organized into vertical slices
**Format:** 8 iterations, each delivering end-to-end value
**Status:** Stable (v0.1 baseline)
**Last Updated:** 2025-09-17

---

## Overview

This project is organized into **8 iterations**, each implementing a vertical slice of functionality. Every iteration builds on the previous ones and delivers testable, demonstrable value.

**Total estimated effort:** 40-60 hours (solo developer)

**Principles:**
- **Vertical slices:** Each iteration delivers end-to-end functionality (not horizontal layers)
- **INVEST stories:** Independent, Negotiable, Valuable, Estimable, Small, Testable
- **Definition of Done:** Code + Tests + Docs updated + Metrics measured (where applicable)
- **No skipping:** Iterations must be completed sequentially (dependencies exist)

## Testing Strategy

### BDD (Behavior-Driven Development)

**Tool:** SpecFlow or similar (Gherkin syntax)

**Feature Files:** See `testing/bdd-feature-seeds.md`

**Tags:**
- `@Iter-{N}`: Scenarios for iteration N
- `@UC-{ID}`: Scenarios for use case
- `@FR-{ID}`: Scenarios for functional requirement
- `@NFR-{ID}`: Scenarios for non-functional requirement

**Execution:**
- Run `@Iter-{N}` scenarios during iteration N
- Run all previous scenarios as regression tests

---

### Unit & Integration Tests

**Unit Tests:**
- SlugGenerator: Test normalization rules
- ConfigManager: Test TOML parsing/validation
- StateMachine: Test state transitions

**Integration Tests:**
- WhisperCLIAdapter: Test with mock CLI executable
- AudioRecorder: Test WAV file creation
- HistoryWriter: Test file creation with front-matter

---

### Manual Testing

**Performance:**
- p95 latency measurement (100 dictations)
- Flyout latency measurement
- Wizard completion time

**Error Scenarios:**
- Microphone denied
- Model hash mismatch
- Hotkey conflict
- Disk full

**Usability:**
- Wizard flow (new user perspective)
- Settings changes
- Reset/uninstall

---

## Definition of Done (Per Iteration)

**Checklist:**
- [ ] All user stories (US-###) implemented and satisfy acceptance criteria
- [ ] All BDD scenarios tagged `@Iter-{N}` pass
- [ ] Unit/integration tests pass (if applicable)
- [ ] Logging added for key state transitions and errors
- [ ] Traceability matrix updated (code modules added)
- [ ] Changelog entry added
- [ ] Performance metrics measured (if NFR applies to this iteration)
- [ ] Error handling implemented per FR-021
- [ ] Specification documents reviewed (updated if needed)
- [ ] No regressions: All previous iteration tests still pass

---

## Iteration Handoff Template

**After completing each iteration:**

1. **Verify DoD** checklist
2. **Commit** code with message referencing iteration and stories
3. **Update** traceability matrix with new code modules
4. **Add** changelog entry
5. **Tag** commit (e.g., `iter-1-complete`)
6. **Document** any issues or decisions for next iteration

---

## Risk Management Per Iteration

### Iteration 1
**Risk:** Hotkey conflicts → **Mitigation:** Clear error detection

### Iteration 2
**Risk:** Audio device errors → **Mitigation:** Robust error handling

### Iteration 3
**Risk:** STT latency exceeds target → **Mitigation:** Measure and optimize if needed

### Iteration 4
**Risk:** p95 latency target missed → **Mitigation:** Profile bottlenecks, parallel writes

### Iteration 5
**Risk:** Wizard is too complex → **Mitigation:** User testing, simplify flow

### Iteration 8
**Risk:** Memory leaks in long-running app → **Mitigation:** Profiling, dispose patterns
